# Weekly Project â€“ Crowdfunding product page

This is my submission for the final week project of the Techy Jaunt Advanced Frontend cohort. The goal of this task was to build a frontend application using **React**. However, due to time constraints and a tight schedule, and resumption preparations, the current version is written in **vanilla JavaScript** with plans to **refactor it to React** soon and make it responsive (it is only on mobile view for now).

### Features (Planned / In Progress)

- [x] Core layout built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- [ ] Refactor to React components
- [ ] Add state management (useState / useReducer or Redux Toolkit)
- [ ] Final styling and responsiveness

## Current Status

The core logic and structure are in place using plain JavaScript. Refactoring into React components is still in progress, and I'm actively working on improving and updating the codebase after submission.
